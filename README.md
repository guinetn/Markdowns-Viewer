- Commands:

## SETTINGS
1. Put your .md files in a folder, e.g. '/md' folder
2. Add the list of these .md files into *md-files.json*  

```json
{ 
  "files":  [ ".\\md\\abc.md", ".\\md\\def.md", ".\\md\\ghi.md", ".\\md\\jkl.md", ".\\md\\mno.md"]
}
```
I create a generator to produce the .json file containing the list of the .md files you want to see:  
>.\generate_json.ps1 $PWD/md  
>.\generate_json.ps1 $PWD/md "md-files.json"   
> * 1st arg: folder to explore (must be a subfolder of the current ($pwd) folder)
> * 2nd (optional) arg: output filename)
